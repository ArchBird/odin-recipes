        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><em>Of course you shouldn't just eat pretzels for dinner. But with a recipe this simple, who needs commitment in the kitchen?</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Baking soda, 2 tbsp</li>
                <li>self rising flour, 1 cup</li>
                <li>Greek Yogurt, 1 cup</li>
                <li>butter, melted, 3 tbsp</li>
                <li>coarse salt, 1 tsp</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring 6 cups of water to a low boil in a large pot. Add baking soda.</li>
                <li>eheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Mix 1 cup flour and Greek yogurt together in a medium bowl until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a surface dusted with more self-rising flour, and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Continue adding flour as needed if the dough is too sticky.</li>
                <li>Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each segment into a long, thin rope, 22 to 24 inches in length. Twist the rope into a pretzel shape by taking the two ends, twisting them around each other, then securing both ends side-by-side onto the center portion of the rope.</li>
                <li>One by one, carefully drop each pretzel into the water and boil until the pretzel floats to the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels or a cooling rack.</li>
                <li>Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and increase the oven's temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Brush the pretzels with some of the melted butter; continue to bake until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes more. Brush with remaining butter and top with coarse salt.</li>
            </ol>
